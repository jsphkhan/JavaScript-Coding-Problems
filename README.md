# JavaScriptCodingProblems
####JavaScript Coding Problem questions and their solutions. 

This repo contains coding problems and their solutions in JavaScript, intended for interviews and job seekers and mainly for a learning purpose.
Solutions to the problems have been written by me, and may not be the best solutions at times. In case, you as a contibutor find any issues, please raise an Issue or a Pull Request.
Questions and their solution can be in each file name or in a folder. 
Most solutions are in plain JavaScript and without any libraries such as jQuery.
